## Analysis and insights
1. Fat Content vs Sales
- Low-Fat items generate significantly higher sales compared to Regular items.
- Health-conscious product preferences are stronger across all market tiers.

2. Fat Content by Tier
- Sales are highest in Tier 3 cities for both Low Fat (₹3.07L) and Regular (₹1.65L) categories.
- Tier 3 contributes the most to total sales, suggesting a large customer base or higher consumption per buyer.

3. Sales by Product Category
- Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods dominate category sales, with over $175K each.
- Seafood and Breakfast categories underperform, with sales below $20K, indicating lower demand or product variety.

4. Sales by Year
- There’s a noticeable increase in sales from 2011 to 2018, peaking in 2018 at ~$204K.
- Sales declined after 2018 and remained stagnant in the following years, possibly due to market saturation or external factors.

5. Sales by Store Size
- Medium and Small stores contribute the most (over $500K and $440K), with High size stores generating the least ($249K).
- Smaller stores appear more agile or better located, supporting higher sales volume.

6. Sales by City Tier
- Tier 3 cities generate the highest total sales (~$472K), surpassing Tier 2 and Tier 1.
- Demand in less urban areas is strong, possibly due to fewer competitors or greater dependence on Blinkit.

7. Sales by Store Type
- Supermarket Type 1 alone contributes 65% of all sales ($787K).
- Grocery Stores and other Supermarket Types each contribute less than $ 150 K.

8. Average Sales per Store Type
- All store types have nearly the same average sale (~$140), suggesting uniform transaction values across formats.
- Despite uniformity in average sales, volume (number of transactions) is what drives the difference in total sales.

9. Count of Transactions by Store Type
- Supermarket Type 1 dominates with 5,577 transactions, nearly 5x that of other store types(Supermarket Type1, 2, 3, grocery store).
- Higher footfall in Type 1 stores drives their overall sales dominance.

## Recommendations
1. Expand the Low Fat product range and prioritize stocking it in Tier 3 cities where demand is highest.
2. Focus on Tier 3 market strategy by increasing investments, logistics, and targeted promotions.
3. Reassess low-performing categories like Seafood and Breakfast to optimize or reposition them.
4. Investigate the decline in sales post-2018 and consider promotional campaigns or app enhancements.
5. Leverage the strong performance of Small and Medium stores by enhancing their supply and inventory systems.
6. Invest in scaling the Supermarket Type1 model, which generates the highest sales and transactions.
7. Enhance the operational efficiency of Type2, Type3, and Grocery Stores through improved marketing, layout, and product mix.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales data, uncovering valuable insights into customer preferences, store performance, and product category contributions. The data highlights strong performance in Tier 3 cities, dominance of Low Fat products, and the efficiency of Small/Medium stores and Supermarket Type 1 formats. However, it also reveals areas for improvement, such as underperforming product categories and post-2018 sales stagnation.

Through data-driven recommendations, the project outlines actionable strategies to optimize product offerings, improve store operations, and align marketing efforts with demand trends. This analysis not only enhances business decision-making but also demonstrates key skills in data cleaning, KPI development, and business storytelling—making it a strong addition to a data analyst portfolio.
